    "- Linked Lists with single connection allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Traversing the Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting all the nodes together in large list of nodes is impractical with as we did in the early example. Instead we will use a temporary external reference to traverse through the list, moving the reference along as we access the individual nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def traversal(head):\n",
    "    curNode = head\n",
    "    while curNode is not None:\n",
    "        print(curNode.data)\n",
    "        curNode = curNode.next\n",
    "```\n",
    "*A complete list traversal requires O(n) time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Searching for a Node\n",
    "Linear search operation can be performed on a linked list, using the same principle we did with traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def unorderedSearch(head, target):\n",
    "    curNode = head\n",
    "    while curNode is not None and curNode.data != target:\n",
    "        curNode = curNode.next\n",
    "    return curNode is not None\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Search operation requires O(n) in the worst case*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prepending Nodes\n",
    "Prepending a node can be done in constant time since no traversal is required, because we simply maintain the head reference. One simple example of prepending:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "newNode = ListNode(item)\n",
    "newNode.next = head\n",
    "head = newNode\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add a new value here are the steps followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new node to store the new value\n",
    "- Set it's next field to point to the node currently at the front of the list\n",
    "- Adjust head to point to the new node since it's now the first node\n",
    "\n",
    "![Prepending a node to the linked list](./figures/addnode2linkedlist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Careful of the order of the new links, because if we link the new node into the list before modifying the head reference we lose our external reference, which results losing the list itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Removing Nodes\n",
    "Removing nodes or unlinking them will simply extract them from the linked list structure. The steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the node containing value and position the external reference pointing to it. \n",
    "- Unlink from the list by setting node's link field to ```None```\n",
    "- Access the node's successor by assigning extra next link to node. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Deleting a node from a linked list:](./figures/removeANode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Removing the first node is a special case, because head references the node. "
